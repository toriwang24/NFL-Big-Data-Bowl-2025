NFL Big Data Bowl Competition on Kaggle.

Description of Competition:
NFL offenses have 40 seconds in which to run a play. That time begins with substitutions, as players run on and off the field until both teams' personnel are configured. It continues into the play call, where both the offensive and defensive units learn their formation and assignments. It ends with myriad strategic decisions by the 22 players on the field, including motion, shifts, and alignment changes, designed to both confuse the opponent and capitalize on any advantages.

In all that action prior to the snap, both teams likely divulge patterns in what players will do after the snap. The goal of this year's competition aims to tell us just what those patterns are.
